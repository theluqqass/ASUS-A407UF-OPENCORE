# What is Hackintosh
# ASUS-A407UF-OPENCORE-BIGSUR-
As the title show, this is Hackintosh setup on Asus laptop with a specification
1) Intel® Core™ i5-8250U processor 1.6 GHz (6M Cache, up to 3.4 GHz)
2) Intel UHD 620 (MX130 not working of course)
All thing function is working ( trackpad, audio etc ) except wifi card ( i use Archer T2U V3 wifi usb to get it working ).

These are some useful links and guide that I follow. And dont forget to change the serial number on the config.plist
