NOW SUPPORT VENTURA
# General Idea of Hackintosh
When Apple announced their switch away from the PowerPC architecture to Intel's processors and chipsets, many were looking forward to having the ability to run Windows software on Apple hardware and Apple's operating systems on their non-Apple hardware. Apple was able to eventually build their Boot Camp feature in Mac OS X 10.5, later allowing Windows to run on Apple hardware. Those hoping to easily run Mac OS X on a standard PC didn't have it so easy.

Even though running Mac OS X on a generic PC is not supported by Apple, it is possible to accomplish given the right hardware and determination by users. Any system that is not made to run the Apple operating system is referred to as Hackintosh. This term comes from the fact that the software needs to be hacked to properly run on Non-Apple hardware. Of course, some of the hardware needs to be tweaked in a few cases as well.

# Specification and What Working
As the title show, this is Hackintosh setup on Asus laptop with a specification
1) Intel® Core™ i5-8250U processor 1.6 GHz (6M Cache, up to 3.4 GHz)
2) Intel UHD 620 (MX130 not working of course)
3) 12GB DDR4 3200Mhz
4) 120GB NVMe and 1TB SATA HDD

More detailed specification on:

All function is working fine ( trackpad, audio etc ) except wifi card ( i use Archer T2U V3 wifi usb to get it working ) and fingerprint.

These are some useful links and guide that I follow. And dont forget to change the serial number on the config.plist
